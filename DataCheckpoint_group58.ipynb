    "In today’s internet based world, product reviews, especially the ones online, play a very important role when it comes to consumer purchasing decisions. Such reviews also have a big impact on the reputation of companies selling the products. With reviews being very important, there could be the possibility that people try to game the system by writing fake reviews. The internet has millions if not billions of reviews for products with the number of reviews growing fast everyday. According to Scott Clark from CMSwire.com, “with the advent of generative AI, fake reviews are becoming more advanced and difficult to detect”.1 As this growth of artificial intelligence continues, so does the possibility of fraudulent reviews generated by bots. We know that there is a possibility of having more fake reviews than real reviews more than ever now due to large language models. With such an important problem, we wanted to see if we are able to classify whether a review is written by a human or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a pressing topic, there have been many attempts to help combat such reviews. For example, according to a study done by Arjun Muherjee and a couple others, “supervised learning was used with a set of review centric features (e.g., unigrams and review length) and reviewer and product centric features (e.g., average rating, sales rank, etc.) to detect fake reviews” (2). The use of features like n grams are important when trying to predict whether or not a review is fake or real. “An AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of 0.78 was reported using logistic regression. The assumption, however, is too restricted for detecting generic fake reviews”.2 This shows that detecting fake reviews might be a bit harder than we initially thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study that went into fake review detection using machine learning methods, states that “fake reviews are differentiated from genuine reviews using four linguistic clues like level of detail, understandability, cognition indicators and writing style”.3 Using features like case of letters, things like if a word was a feeling word, and the words part of speech, the people in the study were able to use machine learning algorithms like logistic regression to classify if a review was genuine or not. However, even these researchers found it difficult to reach a high level of accuracy due to things like the fabricated review being very close to what is considered to be a genuine review.\n",

The target variable labels the review as either Computer Generated ('CG') or Original Review ('O'G). Our dataset does not have any missing values so most of our data cleaning involves little tasks like making the column names and features more intuitive (for readability purposes). We also have to preprocess the text column to make it usable in our analysis, which includes making the text universally lowercase and removing stopwords and punctuation. However, we will keep the original reviews (with stopwords and punctuation) in case it has some meaning later down in our analysis."

    "Classifying fake reviews can be ethically challenging. The case of a false positive is particularly damaging. For example, if our model errs and marks a true review fake, most people would simply discard that information, thereby invalidating the poster’s speech. Furthermore, websites might delete this review, completely preventing someone from sharing their opinion. This is something that we can account for in our model metrics by valuing precision more than recall. However, we cannot fully eliminate this possibility so we would address this issue directly in our results analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ethical concerns of our data source, biases in the data could greatly impact our results. For example, if the curator was biased in their data collection, drawing fake reviews from a subset of products more often than others, producers could be adversely affected by our model’s bias. This is something that we would try to ascertain in our EDA stage, and we would address this thoroughly before any statements on our results. Moreover, certain word choices may be penalized heavier than others, which could unduly target geo/cultural groups. To determine this we would have to audit our model. Additionally, there is a privacy concern with the data collection process, as our data will likely be scraped, data consent may be an issue we encounter. This is of utmost importance, thus we must ensure ethically sourced data prior to any model construction."

Then, include your group’s expectations of one another for successful completion of your COGS108 project below. Discuss and agree on what all of your expectations are. Discuss how your team will communicate throughout the quarter and consider how you will communicate respectfully should conflicts arise. By including each member’s name above and by adding their name to the submission, you are indicating that you have read the COGS108 Team Policies, accept your team’s expectations below, and have every intention to fulfill them. These expectations are for your team’s use and benefit — they won’t be graded for their details.\n",

It is important that each team member is held accountable for their responsibilities so that the group can progress towards our project goals and deadlines. All group members should be included in all communication made regarding the project so that nobody is felt left out or lost. It is also important to have respect and understanding of any extraneous circumstances that may cause someone to not be able to fulfill their duties. In all, it boils down to everyone doing their honest work to the best of their ability, staying up to date with communication on project updates, being involved in discussion, showing up to meetings, and being respectful of one another.\n",

    "Throughout the quarter, we have multiple places of communication from text messaging, discord, and email. Text messaging is primarily used for communication regarding when to meet, keeping each other updated, and any general information about the project. Discord and email is used to share information amongst each other regarding project materials, links, and more technical planning information. In all communication, it is important to be open-minded and respectful of other team members' inputs and ideas. Responses regarding disagreements should be dealt with respectfully and not in a rash, harsh manner. Should this happen, group members will need to meet up in person and find a solution together. It is also important to express to the group if you need help with something instead of just struggling by yourself. Also, going above and beyond on project items is each member’s choice, ability, and hard work."
